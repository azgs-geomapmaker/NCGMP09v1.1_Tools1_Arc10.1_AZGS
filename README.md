#NCGMP09 Tools for ArcGIS

This directory contains an ArcGIS toolbox and associated scripts 
for creating, manipulating, and validating NCGMP09-style geologic 
map databases. See the Docs folder for more information.

1) unzip (if necessary) and place the folder NCGMPToolbox in
a locale of your choice.  Start ArcCatalog or ArcMap, open 
the Arc Toolbox window, right click on empty space in the Arc 
Toolbox window, and select "Add Toolbox".  Then navigate to 
the NCGMPToolbox folder and select the file 
NCGMP09v1.1_Toolbox1_Arc10.0.tbx. 

Right-click again on empty space in the Arc Toolbox window and
select "Save settings" and then "Default" to have the NCGMP09
toolbox available next time you open ArcCatalog or ArcMap.

or, 

2) place the CONTENTS of the folder in your Documents and Settings 
folder, within 
C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\ESRI\Desktop10.0\ArcToolbox\My Toolboxes
(this is the pathname in Windows XP; it may differ with other operating
systems). Then, in ArcCatalog, scroll to the bottom of the left-hand 
"Catalog Tree" pane, open Toolboxes/My Toolboxes, and the new 
toolbox should be present.
